# toolkit-of-ideas

We've established a dedicated space on GitHub to serve as the home for the Toolkit of IDEAS. Each distinct section is organised in its own file, a deliberate choice aimed at facilitating seamless contributions from our community members and providing a transparent view of the Toolkit's evolution. For a comprehensive version, you can access the complete IDEAS Toolkit on Zenodo.
