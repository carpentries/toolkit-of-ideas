### How you can get involved

This is version 2 of the Toolkit of IDEAS. It is not fully comprehensive and will change and grow over time. The hope is that the Carpentries Core Team and community members will continue to update and extend this resource. If you're passionate about inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility and want to contribute to the development of this toolkit, reach out to workshops@carpentries.org to get involved. Together, we can continue to make The Carpentries community a more welcoming and equitable space for all.
