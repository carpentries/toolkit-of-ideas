## Definition

Inclusion is about how people feel. It is creating an atmosphere where learners feel a sense of belonging. Most of us know what it is like to feel included, and most of us have also experienced the feeling of not feeling included, too. 

The Carpentries defines inclusion as “the active, intentional, and ongoing engagement of diverse people and communities that increase awareness, content knowledge, and empathic understanding of how we interact within (and change) our community.” Our goal is to create workshops that are inclusive for everyone.


## How does this connect to our [core values](https://carpentries.org/values/)? 

Inclusion explicitly shows up in the following three core values:



* Value All Contributions: We value all contributions by individuals and entities to our community, code, lessons, and broader ecosystem as long as those contributions adhere to The Carpentries Code of Conduct.
* Inclusive of All: We advocate for inclusivity—welcoming and extending empathy and kindness—to leverage contributions from all community members, regardless of their identity or expression.
* People First: We believe that the individuals who make up our community are the most important part of our organisation and our strongest resource. We strive to make decisions that lower barriers for individual participation.


## Before a workshop


### Questions and actions to consider



* What barriers prevent learners from registering for a Carpentries workshop? How can you ensure your learners feel that a workshop is for them?
    * **Things you can do:**
        * Consider connecting with potential participants from underrepresented groups in your field to express your commitment to inclusion and answer any questions they may have about the workshop. Highlight the relevance of the content to their work or research.
* Who are your role models for inclusion and learning? What qualities did they have as teachers? What specific things did they do to create an inclusive learning environment? 
    * **Things you can do:**
        * Reflect on educators or mentors who inspired you through their inclusive teaching practices. Emulate their strategies by actively engaging with all learners, acknowledging diverse perspectives, and encouraging questions.
* Where and when will you offer a workshop? Who might not be able to attend because of the choices you are making?
    * **Things you can do:**
        *  Make a list of upcoming meetings and events relevant to the audience(s) you hope to engage in and choose a time that does not conflict with other events. 
* What is one new thing you want to try as an Instructor to make this workshop more inclusive? 
    * **Things you can do:**
        * Set a goal for yourself, write it down, and share it with the instructional team before the workshop. Check-in during the workshop on how you are doing and evaluate how you did at the end. 
        * Challenge yourself to incorporate at least one new inclusive teaching strategy into your workshop, such as using inclusive language, facilitating group discussions, or providing multiple ways to engage with the content.
* How do you want to set up the workshop as an inclusive learning environment for this specific group of learners? 
    * **Things you can do:**
        * Include a section in the registration form that allows participants to share any specific needs or accommodations they require to fully participate in the workshop. Ensure confidentiality and follow up with them to provide necessary support.
        * Check the accessibility recommendations in this toolkit for tips on asking what disability accommodations learners need. 
        * For in-person workshops, ensure that the physical space is accessible, including the bathrooms. Where is the nearest gender-neutral bathroom? Is there a place for parents to breast or chest feed or pump milk? 
        * Consider learner needs when scheduling breaks, including
            * Bathroom breaks
            * Breaks that are long enough for parents to breast/chest feed or pump breast milk
            * Snack or meal breaks
            * Breaks to move around and/or stretch 
            * Breaks to reflect on what they are learning
        * If you are offering snacks or catering, include a section in the registration form that allows participants to share any dietary restrictions or preferences.  Ensure that snacks and meals provided accommodate various dietary needs, including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc., so there is food available for everyone. 
        * While planning, identify multiple ways that individuals can participate during the workshop based on individual preferences (e.g. speaking versus adding a comment into the chat).


## During a workshop


### Questions and actions to consider



* What do you want to share about yourself as an Instructor and from when you were a learner?
    * **Things you can do:**
        * **_Optionally_** share information about yourself with your learners. By sharing a bit about when you were a novice learning new concepts or tools, or about times that you have made mistakes, you can contribute [to building psychological safety](https://catlintucker.com/2021/11/psychological-safety/) in the workshop and help learners feel they can speak up when they have questions. Tell learners why The Carpentries’ [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) matters to you.
        * Consider including your pronouns when you introduce yourself and allow others to do the same (but do not make it mandatory). If your language does not have gendered pronouns, be conscious about other ways you might misgender someone with language, and aim to avoid doing so. 
* How might the lesson content impact your learners?
    * **Things you can do:**
        * Consider the dataset(s) you are using in your workshop. Reflect on whether the kinds of data being analysed have the potential to impact your learners negatively.
* How do you, as an Instructor, address disruptive learners? 
    * **Things you can do:**
        * Set ground rules: At the beginning of the workshop, establish ground rules for behaviour that everyone should follow, such as respecting others, refraining from side conversations, and turning off electronic devices during the session.
        * Redirect attention: If you notice a participant is distracted or disengaged, try to redirect their attention by asking them a question, involving them in a group activity, or providing them with a specific task to complete.
        * Engage the group: Encourage group participation and interaction to keep everyone engaged and focused. This can be done through activities, discussion groups, or group work.
        * Take a break: If the distraction continues, consider taking a break to allow participants to stretch, move around, or take a mental break. This can help refocus their attention when the session resumes.
        * Speak privately: If the distraction continues, speak to the participant privately and professionally to understand the reason for their behaviour and provide appropriate support or guidance.
        * If necessary, report the conduct using [The Carpentries Code of Conduct. ](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)


## After a workshop


### Questions and actions to consider



* What went well? What are you proud of? 
    * **Things you can do:**
        * Reflect on the aspects of your workshop that promoted inclusion and led to positive learning experiences for participants. Record those actions to review before future workshops you teach. Celebrate your successes and acknowledge the impact of your efforts.
* What would you change next time? 
    * **Things you can do:**
        * Identify areas where you believe your workshop could have been more inclusive. Consider seeking participant feedback to gain insights into their perspectives and suggestions for improvement.
        * Engage in constructive feedback with your co-Instructor to evaluate your teaching methods and inclusion practices. Encourage open dialogue and ask them to pinpoint areas for improvement rather than focusing solely on positive feedback.
        * Review the post-workshop survey results from the learners to understand whether they felt the environment was inclusive. 
        * Commit to implementing one specific inclusion-related change before your next workshop, such as incorporating a new activity or providing additional resources. Share this commitment with your instructional team to create accountability and track progress.
