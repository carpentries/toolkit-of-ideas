## Definition

Diversity is about who is in the room. 

The Carpentries defines diversity as “individual differences (e.g. personality, language, learning preferences, and life experiences) and group-social differences (e.g. race, ethnicity, class, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, sexual identity, country of origin and ability status, as well as cultural, political, religious or other affiliations) that can be engaged in the service of learning.” Our goal is to offer workshops for diverse audiences.

The lack of diversity in the tech industry can perpetuate these issues. If coding and data science teams lack diversity, their products and services are less likely to consider the needs and experiences of underrepresented groups.


## How does this connect to our [core values](https://carpentries.org/values/)? 

Diversity explicitly shows up in the following core value: 



* Strength through Diversity: Appreciating that identities are complex and individual, we believe in empowering a diverse group of people to work with data and code to answer the questions important to them and to address challenges in science and society.


## Before a workshop


### Questions and actions to consider



* Who is not represented in your workshop? Where can you promote your workshop to reach people who have not attended before? Both in terms of demographics, meaning gender, race, disability, and age, and in terms of disciplines, such as digital humanities, microbiology, population health, and so on.
    * **Things you can do: **
        * The Carpentries does outreach to specific organisations and communities that are underrepresented. For universities offering on-campus workshops, check to determine if these organisations also have branches/chapters at your campus. Building relationships with them is a great way to reach students and recruit Instructors to build a more diverse Instructor pool. 
            * In the U.S., The Carpentries does outreach with:
                * [National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)](https://www.nsbe.org/)
                * [Native BioData Consortium](https://nativebio.org/)
                * [Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS)](https://www.sacnas.org/)
                * [Society of Women Engineers (SWE)](https://swe.org/) 
                * [The National Association of Multicultural Engineering Program Advocates (NAMEPA)](https://namepa.org/)
                * [The National GEM Consortium](https://www.gemfellowship.org/)
            * Globally, The Carpentries does outreach to organisations including, but not limited to: 
                * [Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya](https://bhki.org/)
                * [H3ABioNet](https://www.h3abionet.org/)
                * [NSBE Ghana](http://nsbeghana.com/)
                * [OpenCider](https://www.opencider.org/)
                * [Women of WACREN](https://wacren.net/en/programmes/women-in-wacren/)
* What campus or community meetings can you speak at to start building new relationships?
    * **Things you can do: **
        * Find places to promote your workshop to reach people who have not attended before. 
* Who are the Instructors? Who are the helpers? What agreements does the teaching team have to model a respectful learning environment?
    * **Things you can do: **
        * Discuss with your instructional team the importance of creating a respectful and inclusive learning environment. Develop clear agreements on behaviour and communication that reflect these values.
* How do we honour different styles of learning and ways of knowing? 
    * **Things you can do: **
        * Recognise that participants may have diverse learning styles and ways of acquiring knowledge. Encourage active participation and provide flexibility in learning approaches. Emphasise that there is no one-size-fits-all learning style.
        * Incorporate whiteboards, sticky notes, or other multimedia tools to support different learning styles.
* Could the material I plan to teach make a participant feel stereotyped or disempowered?
    * **Things you can do:**
        * Review the material you plan to teach with a critical eye to identify any instances that could perpetuate stereotypes or disempower participants. For example, data sets underrepresenting certain racial or ethnic groups may lead to biased decision-making that disproportionately affects those groups. Ensure that the content is respectful, inclusive, and empowering for all.


## During a workshop


### Questions and actions to consider



* How can you acknowledge that learners may have what they perceive as naive or novice questions? What can you do to make it safe to ask these questions in the workshop? 
    * **Things you can do: **
        * Create a welcoming atmosphere by explicitly stating that all questions are valuable, regardless of their complexity. Emphasise that everyone is on their learning journey, and curiosity is encouraged.
        * As the facilitator, demonstrate a non-judgmental attitude by being open to all questions, regardless of complexity. Encourage participants to ask questions by asking some yourself, especially basic ones, to set the tone.
        * Implement anonymous question submission methods, such as digital platforms or anonymous surveys, to give participants a safe space to ask questions without fear of judgment.
        * Throughout the workshop, use inclusive language that emphasises a collaborative learning environment. Phrases like "Let us explore this together" or "We are all here to learn" promote inclusivity.
* Who asks questions or speaks up in your workshop, and who does not? 
    * **Things you can do: **
        * Observe the dynamics of participant engagement in your workshop. Encourage equal participation by actively inviting input from all attendees, especially those who may be less vocal. Give them opportunities to contribute in ways that are most comfortable (e.g., speaking versus adding a comment to the Zoom chat).
* Are you aware of your own biases? Which biases show up for you in a workshop setting? 
    * **Things you can do: **
        * Affinity bias is a type of unconscious bias where we gravitate towards people who are like us. Learn more about [19 types of unconscious bias](https://asana.com/resources/unconscious-bias-examples).
        * Take an implicit[ bias ](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html)self-assessment to raise personal awareness. 


## After a workshop


### Questions and actions to consider



* What did you learn about diversity from this workshop? What will you do differently next time? 
    * **Things you can do: **
        * Reflect on any biases or assumptions you might have had and how the workshop helped you become more aware of them.
        * Make a plan of how you will implement changes in future workshops to be more inclusive, such as adapting materials, promoting diverse perspectives, or adjusting your teaching methods.
* What follow-up will you do with learners to build on the relationships you have begun with them? 
    * **Things you can do: **
        * Establish a follow-up plan to maintain connections with participants and nurture a supportive learning community. Provide resources, networking opportunities, or mentorship to continue supporting their growth.
        * Identify some places where learners can go next on their journey in data skills and coding.
        * Invite learners to be part of the Carpentries community by introducing them to the [Welcome Tip Sheet](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8124923) and encouraging them to join a monthly welcome session. 
        * Identify resources for new coders on your campus or in your geographic area. 
        * Research and share information about other mentorship and learning communities in open science, such as [PyLadies](https://pyladies.com/), [RLadies](https://rladies.org/), [Black in Data](https://www.blackindata.co.uk/), and [other networking communities for underrepresented data scientists](https://builtin.com/data-science/diversity-inclusion-networking-communities). 
        * Create informal networks of support for learners as well as find/create/share professional opportunities.
