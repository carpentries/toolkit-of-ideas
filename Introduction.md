# The Carpentries Commitment to IDEA


## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statement

Our Community is Our Strength

At The Carpentries, we are committed to building a diverse, equitable, and inclusive community that values all individuals and their unique identities. We prioritise accessibility and inclusivity in our curricula and programs and value transparency, fairness, and honesty to build trust within our community. Building an inclusive community is an ongoing process that requires consistent effort and commitment, and we strive for continuous improvement.


## Accessibility Statement

The Carpentries is committed to providing inclusive and accessible content that enables all individuals, including those with disabilities, to participate and engage fully. We are actively working to increase the accessibility and usability of Carpentries‚Äô content and, in doing so, adhere to many of the available standards and guidelines, including those from the World Wide Web Consortium.


# Introduction


## What is the Toolkit of IDEAS? 

The Toolkit of IDEAS (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility Strategies) is a practical resource for Carpentries‚Äô Instructors, helpers, and workshop hosts. We know that many people care about inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility but are not sure how it connects to teaching foundational coding and data science skills. This toolkit aims to bridge this gap. This is version 1, which means it is a starting point and not a fully comprehensive resource. The hope is that the Core Team and community members will continue to update and extend this resource over time. 


## What was the process for creating this toolkit? 

The Toolkit of IDEAS came out of the recommendations from ReadySet, a diversity, equity, and inclusion consulting firm that did an organisational assessment of The Carpentries in 2020. Kari L. Jordan, Executive Director of The Carpentries, conceived the idea and obtained funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to execute it. She then contracted Tara Robertson Consulting Inc. in March 2022 to help lead this project. 

Tara Robertson consulted with Carpentries‚Äô Team Leads and then worked with Alycia Crall and Brynn Elliott to hold four listening sessions with the community‚Äîtwo on diversity, equity, and inclusion on June 9, 2022, and two on accessibility on June 23, 2022. Forty members from the community attended, and nine written submissions were provided through a form. We also contacted leaders in Africa, Latin America, Australia, and Aotearoa/New Zealand to get additional input and to ensure the toolkit is not too U.S.-focused (it still might be!) The first draft of the toolkit was presented during two sessions at CarpentryCon 2022, The Carpentries conference biennial, to provide an opportunity for additional community input. Recommendations made during those sessions were then incorporated by Brynn Elliott, in consultation with the Community Development Team, to create the Toolkit of IDEAS 2.0. 


### Changes and improvements



* Inclusion of DEI and Accessibility Statements
* Inclusion of sections on intersectionality and how to manage disruptive learners 
* Host-specific information for contacting Disability Support Services on campus or utilising human resources or diversity and inclusion departments for setting up accommodations.
* More examples of potential actions to address these topics
* Restructured format to enhance the flow of sections, making it easier for readers to access relevant information.


## How is the toolkit organised? 

For each of the four sections in the toolkit, you will find:



* A definition of the topic
* How it connects to The Carpentries' values
* Things you can do to support the topic:
    * Before the workshop
    * During the workshop
    * After the workshop

Shared values are the starting point for communities of practice as they identify principles that guide their behaviour. Where applicable, we reference [The Carpentries Values](https://carpentries.org/values/) throughout this toolkit as they guide how we advocate for inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility.

The ‚Äúbefore,‚Äù ‚Äúduring‚Äù and ‚Äúafter‚Äù sections take a BOTH/AND approach. They include BOTH questions for you to reflect on AND concrete things you can do to promote inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility. When considering the questions and tips, consider your role in supporting a Carpentries workshop (i.e. Instructor, helper, workshop host). Within these sections, we also incorporate intersectionality, recognising the multifaceted aspects of individuals' identities. It creates an inclusive environment where learners experience a sense of belonging, acknowledging that each person's unique identity intersects with various social, cultural, and personal factors.

A commitment to inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility requires a shift in mindset and continuous learning. As we are a global project with Instructors and learners from many different backgrounds running workshops in different environments, it is impossible to make a checklist that works for all of these scenarios. The questions to consider are intended for reflection and discussion. There are no right answers.

We heard in the community listening sessions that Instructors felt a desire for checklists and tactical advice, which is why we have included lists of things you can consider doing in each section. Inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility are not checklists, however. You need to be curious to learn, humble when you get it wrong, and take time to reflect on your growth and learning, as well as how you want to do things in the future. It is an ongoing learning process.
