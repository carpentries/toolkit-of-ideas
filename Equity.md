## Definition

Equity is about fairness and justice. **Equity** must not be confused with **equality.** Equality means individuals are given the same resources or opportunities. Equity recognises that each person has different circumstances and allocates the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an intended outcome.

The Carpentries defines equity as “the creation of opportunities for equal access to and participation in programs that are capable of closing participation gaps in our community.” Our goal is to offer workshops where everyone can participate and learn.


## How does this connect to our [core values](https://carpentries.org/values/)? 

Equity is implied in the core value: 



* People First: We believe that the individuals who make up our community are the most important part of our organisation and our strongest resource. We strive to make decisions that lower barriers to individual participation.


## Before a workshop


### Questions and actions to consider



* How are the workshop fees (if any) equitable? 
    * **Things you can do:**
        * Identify options for reduced fees or scholarships to ensure affordability for all participants.
* Who is organising the logistics for the workshop? This means booking the catering, cleaning up the garbage in the room at the end of the day, booking the room and picking up the keys, and other necessary administrative tasks. Is the division of this work equitable? 
    * **Things you can do: **
        * Identify a workshop host who can take care of the logistics.  
* Some Instructors teach as part of their paid jobs, while some Instructors volunteer their teaching services. Think about volunteer vs. paid time for Instructors—what is equitable in your situation? 
    * **Things you can do: **
        * Ask your co-Instructor if it would be helpful to write a short email to their supervisor documenting their contributions to the community through teaching this workshop. 
* Is access to computers a barrier for some learners?
    * **Things you can do: **
        * If access is a barrier, brainstorm solutions. Is there a computer lab or library on campus that you could use? Can you partner with other organisations to borrow or use the equipment? 
* Is childcare a barrier for participants?
    * **Things you can do: **
        * Figure out concrete supports for parents and caregivers. This might include arranging a fund to reimburse childcare costs, partnering with the campus daycare, or scheduling the workshop at a time that does not conflict with school pickup or dropoff. 


## During a workshop


### Questions and actions to consider



* What does equitable participation in a Carpentries workshop look like for you?
    * **Things you can do:**  
        * Mentally log (or take turns as Instructors actually logging!) who speaks the most during a workshop. Check-in with the quieter folks during breaks, or invite them to respond during question and answer periods. 
        * The workshop environment should be inclusive and welcoming to all participants. This includes accessible physical spaces, materials, and digital platforms to accommodate various needs and abilities.
* How are you ensuring that everyone is invited to participate throughout the workshop? 
    * **Things you can do:**
        * Ensure learners are aware of when questions can be asked, including during breaks. 
        * If using a collaborative notes tool during your workshop, remind learners that their feedback can be shared anonymously.
        * Do not always call on the loudest, most experienced or fastest learner. Create opportunities for quieter and less experienced learners who need more time to participate. 


## After a workshop


### Questions and actions to consider



* How does teaching Carpentries workshops get recognised in your organisation or career trajectory? 
    * **Things you can do:**
        * Advocate for Carpentries teaching and instructional pedagogy to be valued in formal recognition and promotion processes.
        * Invite Core Team Members from The Carpentries to speak with leadership at colleges and universities. 
        * Invite faculty and leadership to observe part of a workshop to notice the impact of the teaching style on the energy and engagement of the classroom.
* How can you raise the profile of the work involved in teaching for The Carpentries in your organisation?
    * **Things you can do:**
        * Leverage The Carpentries pedagogy to create inclusive learning environments and gain immediately applicable teaching skills.
        * Apply The Carpentries' formalised pedagogical model, showcasing your dedication to a community with common objectives.
        * Utilise openly accessible Carpentries resources to enhance your teaching and contribute to educational materials.
        * Take advantage of streamlined Carpentries processes to provide tangible evidence of your teaching and contributions to educational resources.
